# PEST_Routine and Adaptive threshold hunting
Generate a PEST routine for instance based on Lieberman and Pentland
(1982) to determine the threshold for simulated responses
Implements Lieberman and Pentland routine
– Return your Matlab PEST-routine
– Demonstrate the PEST procedure and 95% CIs
– How many trials were required to achieve good enough confidence for
the threshold value to fall within a window of ±5% of estimated threshold
value
