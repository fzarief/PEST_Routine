# PEST_Routine and Adaptive threshold hunting
Generate a PEST routine for instance based on Lieberman and Pentland
(1982) to determine the threshold for simulated responses
Implements Lieberman and Pentland routine. Demonstrate the PEST procedure and 95% CIs in which the threshold value to fall within a window of Â±5% of estimated threshold value
